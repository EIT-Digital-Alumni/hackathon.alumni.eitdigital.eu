This way, the outgoing Board will be able to share their projections and business plan with the new one and you, to <strong>receive feedback</strong> and plan together our strategy for 2019 and the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will be a long weekend of discussions, from Friday 31 May to Sunday 2 June -&nbsp;but we'll keep it cool, promised!
