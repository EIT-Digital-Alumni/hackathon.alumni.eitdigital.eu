    value: "<p>EIT Digital is looking for volunteers to help with the EIT Digital Master School Kick-Off on Otaniemi campus on 18-21 October 2017. The Kick-Off is the first joint event for the roughly 350 students who have started their Master’s studies in EIT Digital Master School at different universities across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the kick-off about?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kick-off is the common “orientation event” for the 350 first-year Master School students scattered across Europe, and the first project in their Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship minor. It is organized every year at one of the Master School university locations, and this year it’s Aalto’s turn to stand in the spotlight! The Master School students’ main task during the event is the business challenge – a team project that they work on for three days, present the outcome, and compete for winning the challenge on the last day. During the event, high-profile speakers and professional coaches will provide guidance and inspiration to the teams. In addition, they will attend information events regarding their studies, get the chance to network with each other as well as EIT Digital’s company partners, and on the top of it all, enjoy an elegant gala dinner at a unique location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What do we offer for volunteers?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our volunteers are the key to make this event an unforgettable experience. Since there is a lot of programme, we need people to make all the transfers as smooth as possible. You can work in the cloakroom, at the registration desk, at the information desk, help putting up signs and moving furniture, or work as a mentor for the teams in the business challenge. You get to be in the middle of the buzz of a total of 400 international ICT-entrepreneurial talents and industry partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also offer to you:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- 1-2 ECTS (a report may be required)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- A special goodie bag, including a cool hoodie</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The chance to follow interesting high-profile presentations and speeches during free time</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Participation in the evening programmes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Free lunches and dinners</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Valuable experience on organizing big events</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Pizza evening together with other volunteers after the event</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who can join and how?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alumni, Bachelor and Master level students from all schools of Aalto University are welcome to join as volunteers. Mentors in the business challenge should be Master level students or EIT Digital / Aalto Ventures Programme alumni.
