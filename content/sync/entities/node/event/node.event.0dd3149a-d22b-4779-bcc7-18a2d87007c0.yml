Our digital footprint let them uniquely identify us and even trace our daily habits. Our digitalized world is becoming scarier if you consider how much information we put over the internet. It’s worth trying to stay on top of how you handle your personal information and know what is at stake. In this tech talk, we will discuss <strong>Digital identity in the 21st century</strong>, its challenges and the way forward. We will look at the evolution of the digital identity and the need for a user-centric identity where a user is a self-sovereign. We will discuss the principles of self-sovereign identity and how blockchain technology can help us move in that direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to this event, you will have the opportunity to spice up the program with what you have been working on professionally or otherwise.
