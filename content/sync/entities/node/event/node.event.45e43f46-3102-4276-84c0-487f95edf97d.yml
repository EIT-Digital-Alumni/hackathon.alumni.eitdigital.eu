    value: "<p>BioHealth Computing Schools, in collaboration with EIT RawMaterials, have offered a <strong>full Scholarship for up to 10 of our members</strong> to attend their upcoming <a href=\"http://safernanodesign.eu/\">school on Safer Nanomaterials</a>, to be held at the <strong>European Scientific Institute</strong> in Archamps, Greater Geneva, on 2-10&nbsp;May 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.safernanodesign.eu/\">summer school</a> is an accelerated learning programme proposed by EIT RawMaterials partner institutions and the European Scientific Institute. The course addresses the complex challenge of the substitution of critical raw materials through the <strong>use of nanotechnology</strong>, promoting a ‘safety-by-design’ concept, which seeks to <strong>minimise environmental and human health risks</strong> related to nanotechnology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe selected participants will&nbsp;be <strong>not required to pay the registration fee</strong>, and will be offered <strong>free meals and accommodation</strong> during the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Selection Criteria</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This course is open to Masters or PhD students in computer science, medical or life science, biotechology, engineering, materials, data science, business, human and social science.&nbsp;The course is also worth 6 ECTs. Your ideas for<strong> innovative nano-enabled devices and services </strong>will form the basis of the school’s innovation and entrepreneurial groupwork. This will culminate in a pitching session in front of a panel of international experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.biohealth-computing.eu/safer-nanomaterials/\">deadline for applications</a> has been<strong> extended to 22 March</strong>!
