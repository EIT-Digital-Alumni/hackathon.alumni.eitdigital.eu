    value: "<p>We believe that having a strong network of the female students at EIT could help create a sense of belonging. We want to provide an opportunity to learn new technical skills, that can be used for future class projects, in a comfortable environment.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is why we start the event with a workshop to get female students familiar with Arduino. After this we want to allow the female students from EIT to have an informal gathering with snacks and drinks where they could get to know each other better. The event is powered by EIT Digital but welcomes students and Alumni from other KICs, like KIC-InnoEnergy, Climate-KIC and EIT Health. So install the Arduino Software, bring your laptops and see you next Thursday :)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nView <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2e6y21E\">the pictures of the event</a>!</p>\r\n"
