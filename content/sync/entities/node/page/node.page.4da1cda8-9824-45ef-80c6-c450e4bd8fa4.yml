As part of our mission, we organise meetups and events for our community members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have prepared these guidelines to help our members interested in <strong>organizing an event</strong> on behalf of the EIT Digital Alumni. You will find here useful suggestions on how to plan and execute any event funded by the Foundation, regardless of the type (e.g. meet-up, workshop, hackathon, etc.) or the location where it is held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please keep in mind the following key steps before, during and after your event. In case of further doubts or questions, do not hesitate to get back in contact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Before applying for Alumni Board support</h2>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Define a topic, general concept and goal(s) of the event</p>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">The most important aspect is to clearly communicate <strong>“What is the event about?”</strong></p>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">There are many sources of inspiration you can rely on, e.g.: Are you an expert or passionate about some specific topic? What kind of skills would you like to learn or further develop? Is there some trending topic in your city or social community that should be worth discussing with others?</p>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Always keep in mind to outline <strong>clear objectives</strong> when deciding on an idea for a meetup. When it comes to social gatherings, besides meeting and networking with other alumni, you should also consider why your idea is worth to be supported (i.e. funded and promoted) by the Foundation. Why is your event different from any regular meet-ups that can be organized directly with your friends or via social media?</p>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Decide the <strong>date and location</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Feel free to contact directly your closest <strong>Co-Location Centre (CLC)</strong> manager: You will find they are usually very cooperative and willing to help.</p>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Your event could also be held at a <strong>startup or external company</strong>. This option is very convenient, because many companies are interested in promoting themselves to potential partners and searching for prospective job applicants. In some cases, they may even provide you the venue, food and drinks for free!</p>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">The Alumni Board and Local Community volunteers can also help you look for the availability of <strong>other venues</strong> in your city</p>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Consider the availability of any invited <strong>external speaker(s)</strong> and your audience when choosing a date</p>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Submit your event application <a href=\"http://bit.ly/event-proposal-app\">HERE</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Alumni Board will review your application and decide whether the proposed event is eligible to receive funding from the Foundation. We will do our best to give you an answer within one week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to our Financial Plan, we have a reference budget limit of <strong>300€ per event</strong> but this amount can be allocated flexibly (higher or lower value) depending on various factors, such as the ones indicated in the General Guidelines. If you determine there are compelling reasons to give a higher budget for your event, please inform the board the estimated amount and <strong>explain briefly why</strong> in the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/event-proposal-app\">application form</a>.

We encourage you to scout for sponsorships, as long as it is beneficial to both parties. Hypothetically, sponsors can support in kind (via catering or venue) or in cash.

Fill out the\_<a href=\"http://bit.ly/template-external\">External Expenses Template</a>\_and return it via email to\_<a href=\"mailto:events.alumni@eitdigital.eu?subject=EIT%20Digital%20Alumni%20event\">events.alumni@eitdigital.eu</a>\_and/or\_<a href=\"mailto:treasurer.alumni@eitdigital.eu?subject=EIT%20Digital%20Alumni%20event\">treasurer.alumni@eitdigital.eu</a>\_with all invoices attached.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The reimbursement claim(s) must be sent <strong>within 30 days after the\_event. </strong>Please note this time may be shorter if your event is happening in November or December, because<strong> </strong>we can only reimburse expenses <strong>during the same fiscal year</strong> when they were\_incurred.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For expenses incurred during longer trips (i.e. those which include flights and accommodation abroad), the reimbursements must\_be requested via the <a href=\"https://www.rydoo.com/en\">Rydoo</a> application.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In all cases, take HQ photos of the receipts and upload them, but <strong>do not get rid of the original paper invoices</strong> until the Treasurer approves your expense report.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\_</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Sponsorships</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Opportunities to get <strong>event sponsors</strong> or establish <strong>longer-term collaborations</strong> are very valuable to us. We encourage you to scout for sponsorships, as long as it is beneficial to both parties. Hypothetically, sponsors can support in kind (via catering or venue) or in cash. On the other hand, <strong>companies partnering with the EIT Digital Alumni</strong> can benefit from the following aspects:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Brand awareness</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Direct contact with our pool of highly-qualified talents</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Identifying potential partners</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Identifying prospective job applicants and future employees</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Positive public relations</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Exposure to an EU institutional network</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contact the Alumni Board if you require any promotional or communications material for sponsors.</p>\n\n<p>\_</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Supporting links and tools</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here the recap of the tools listed in the Guidelines above:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/event-proposal-app\">Event Proposal Application</a></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/alumni-event-report\">Event Report Form</a></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/event-gantt-schedule\">Event Agenda + Gantt Chart</a></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/event-kanban\">Event Kanban organization</a></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/checklist-for-event\">Checklist for events</a></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/template-external\">External Expenses Template</a></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/reporting-faq\">Cost Reporting FAQ</a></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Feel free to send to <a href=\"mailto:events.alumni@eitdigital.eu\">events.alumni@eitdigital.eu</a> any comments, feedback and suggestions on how to improve our events (and these guidelines) further.</p>\n\n<p>\_</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Last updated: 24.
