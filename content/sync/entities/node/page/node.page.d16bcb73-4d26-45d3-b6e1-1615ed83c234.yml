If IP anonymization is activated on this website and you are located within a member state of the European Union or another country that is a signatory to the agreement regarding the European Economic Area, however, your IP address will be abbreviated before being transmitted to the USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address first be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and then abbreviated. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate the use of the website, to generate reports regarding website activities, and to provide additional services associated with the use of the website and the Internet to the website operator. The IP address that your browser transmits in the context of Google Analytics will not be amalgamated with other Google data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can prevent cookies from being saved on your computer by altering the appropriate settings in your browser. However, we must inform you that in this case, you will not be able to use the complete range of functions that this website offers.

The Google +1 button provides you and other users with personalized content from Google and our partners.

Your +1 may be displayed in connection with your profile name and photo on Google services – such as Google search results or your Google profile – or in other locations on websites or ads on the Internet. Google records information about your +1 activity in order to improve Google services for you and others. In order to use the Google +1 button, you will need an internationally visible, public Google profile that must contain a name, even if it is only a name that was specifically chosen for that profile. This name will be used across all Google services. In some cases, this name can replace another name that you previously used to share content via your Google account. Your Google profile identity can be displayed for users who know your e-mail address or who have other information that could be used to identify you. Usage of the data collected: In addition to the uses mentioned above, the information that you provide will be used in accordance with applicable Google data privacy regulations. Google may publish aggregated statistics about users’ +1 activity, and/or it may pass this information on to users and partners such as publishers, advertisers, or associated websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Data Privacy Statement for the Use of Twitter</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Functions of the online service Twitter are integrated into our website.

Each website or third party service provider used by the website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website or third party service provider to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites or other third-party service providers. A cookie will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or what’s in your shopping basket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What is a browser?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A browser is an application that allows you to surf the internet.

Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyze your use of our sites and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example, you may choose to personalize the content of a website in order to see the latest news and weather for your region. In order to do this, a cookie is placed on your device to remember where you live so that we deliver the information that has been requested by you.

This name will be used across all Google services. In some cases, this name can replace another name that you previously used to share content via your Google account. Your Google profile identity can be displayed for users who know your e-mail address or who have other information that could be used to identify you. Usage of the data collected: In addition to the uses mentioned above, the information that you provide will be used in accordance with applicable Google data privacy regulations.
