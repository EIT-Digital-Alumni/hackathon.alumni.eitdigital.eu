    value: "<p>A couple of weeks ago, the current&nbsp;Alumni Board had its first physical meeting together in Brussels. Two days of intense&nbsp;discussions with a long list of points&nbsp;that we were eager to review since being elected in June this year.

We aim at making this value more visible not only to external stakeholders&nbsp;but also to our own members, by expanding our reach beyond regular meetup events, supporting the creation of new working groups and developing longer-term training programs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of&nbsp;all these discussions, we have defined a long list of action points that we will focus on during our 2019-2021 mandate and we can’t wait to get started!
