    value: "<p>The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/innovation/policy/social/competition_en\">European Social Innovation Competition</a> is an initiative of the European Commission that awards <strong>three 50.000 Euro prizes per year </strong>to the most innovative ideas developed to address social issues in EU Member States and beyond. Now in its seventh year, the theme this time is <strong>RE:THINK LOCAL</strong>, calling on projects that make use of the local characteristics of a place in order to create opportunities for young people in our changing economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competition is held in memory of the Portuguese innovator Diogo Vasconcelos. It is a great opportunity for talented people to get their social innovation idea off the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/users/dorapalfi\">Dora Palfi</a>, co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/womenEIT/\">Women@EIT</a>, decided to take this fantastic opportunity in hand. She is CEO and Co-Founder of <a href=\"https://www.imagicase.com/\">ImagiCase</a> and joined the competition with her startup. The company, based in Sweden, wants to provide a mobile platform for tangible and expressive coding education, built by girls for girls. The platform pairs with the imagiCase devices, the first product being a phone case with an embedded LED matrix that can be programmed to display any text or pattern: this way users learn to code through customising their accessory. The platform also provides tutorials of coding concepts guiding the user through the journey of learning to code in a gamified way, and it also fosters an online community of girls learning to code through the possibility of sharing one’s creations on a design feed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, the competition was rather stiff and only 30 projects have been selected to enter the next phase of the competition - out of 731 eligible entries from 39 countries. <a href=\"https://www.imagicase.com/\">ImagiCase</a> is one of them! And it is now moving towards the next stop: an intensive three-day training programme called “The Academy”, which this year takes place in the beautiful city of Cluj in Romania. Here, the 30 semi-finalist projects will receive mentorship from experienced social innovators and entrepreneurs, and have the opportunity to develop what for many is just an idea at this stage into a viable business proposition. Of course, they all hope to secure a place among the 10 finalists in the next selection round, and to ultimately be one of the 3 winners in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to wish <a href=\"https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/users/dorapalfi\">Dora</a> an enormous success with the next stages of the competition, and many congratulations for what you ended up to achieve until now!</p>\r\n"
