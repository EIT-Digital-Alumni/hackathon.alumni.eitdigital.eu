But the challenge is that if things do not change in Europe, globally&nbsp;it will also be a problem.

This was in line with the organisers' idea of an impact presentation for the session. The aims of the discussion was to:<br />\r\n- identify the essential characteristics of successful innovation workplaces. (i.e. organisational structure, leadership style, values, mission, aims, etc.);<br />\r\n- identify what the most effective sustainable projects to pursue;<br />\r\n- identify the most common traits in the attitudes of young people focused on sustainable innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second session was on <strong>“Incentives for Sustainable Innovation”</strong>. Andre Meyer from the European Commission in his impact presentation challenged participants not to stand in the way of innovation and made it known that the role is to allow, facilitate and link people with ideas. The aims of the discussion of the second session was to:<br />\r\n- identify means of motivation to push young people to create sustainable entrepreneurial ventures;<br />\r\n- create a list of incentives available to the public to support entrepreneurial ventures with sustainable goals;<br />\r\n-&nbsp;identify the role of institutions, companies and NGOs, to push young people to pursue viable entrepreneurial ventures;<br />\r\n- collect relevant examples of successful examples of venture creation and identify the main reason for success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the group discussions, members of JADE were the moderators to control the flow of affairs.
