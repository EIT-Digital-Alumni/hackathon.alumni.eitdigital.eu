    value: "<p>Dear everyone!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We bring to you three very happy announcements:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New website</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"http://alumni.eitdigital.eu\">new EIT Digital Alumni website</a> :) We hope this new website will help us to communicate better. We will post news and events there, and little by little we will all be able to contribute to alumni-exclusive content and discussions with our own user accounts. As of today, if you register in the new website, you become an EIT Digital Alumni registered member. So go and <a href=\"http://alumni.eitdigital.eu\">register now</a>!<br />\r\nThanks to this work, the foundation is now in complete control of the website, that means that the website is yours. If you would like to collaborate in building cool stuff for the community, write to alumni@eitdigital.eu to join the team!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First EIT Digital Alumni Reunion (registration deadline: October 28th)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes! We're coordinating the first EIT Digital Alumni Reunion with the second graduation ceremony so the first two cohorts of the Master School can meet and party together on November 27-28th in Budapest. We didn't have an \"after party\" celebration after our graduation dinner, so this is your chance to get that fixed while welcoming the second cohort as new alumni.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What's the deal? The foundation pays for your accommodation, you pay for your travel tickets. The proposed schedule is the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Friday 27th 18:00: join the gala dinner of the graduation ceremony (optional).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Friday 27th 23:00: <strong>after party</strong>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Saturday 28th 12:00 - 18:00: alumni meetup to catch up, discuss the new by-laws of the foundation and team up for current and future projects</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be 100 slots for getting free accommodation, in a first-come first-served basis. The registration deadline is Wednesday October 28th. You need to register in the \"Alumni Reunion\" page of the website, for which you need to have a website account. You can participate in all three activities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EIT Alumni Startup Days</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We're organizing our first cross-KIC event, and it's big: the <strong>EIT Alumni Startup Days</strong>. It's happening on November 6-8th (yes, the whole weekend!) in Barcelona, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Berlin and Paris. It's a non-profit event, and the ticket costs only 10€ (it includes mentoring, food and drinks all weekend long). It's a nice chance to do some interdisciplinary work with people from different EIT Digital majors and even different KICs (Climate-KIC and KIC InnoEnergy), and you can work on any idea you want while mentors help you with the sustainability aspect of it. Get your tickets ASAP!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope to meet you soon in any of the upcoming events. And please remember that we can support your own event as well!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Alumni Team</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-----------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, we have an extra announcement:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New Events Officer wanted</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we want to let you know that Prithvi decided to step out of the board because of personal and professional reasons. The board is very sad to let him go; he worked very hard, not only as an Events Officer but on countless aspects of the foundation. We should all be very proud of him and wish him luck in his next adventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're interested in joining as an interim Events Officer until the next board elections, please write a short email to alumni@eitdigital.eu saying why you would like to have this responsibility and why you are suitable for this role. The interim Events Officer will be selected by the board and announced during the Alumni Reunion. People from the cohort 2014 and also 2015 can apply.</p>\r\n"
