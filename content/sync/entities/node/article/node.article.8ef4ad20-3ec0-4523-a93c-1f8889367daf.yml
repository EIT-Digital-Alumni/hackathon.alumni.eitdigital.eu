    value: "<p>Last weekend we gathered the leaders of our working groups to Madrid for our annual working group meeting. We used the time together to refresh our current leaders and onboard the new leaders who filled out our working group survey. We also worked on our collective vision we have for the working groups, had some valuable 1-on-1 time and focus topics, and ideated over what events our working groups can plan to do with their own communities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had the pleasure of inviting an alumni founded company “Kimitisik” to help us with 2 workshops. The first workshop, on our Identity and Vision for the EIT Digital Alumni, participants were divided into groups focussed on Strategy, Values &amp; Culture and Operational Excellence. The groups then brainstormed the problems we are facing as a community in these areas and what are some possible ideas/solutions we can do to move forward. The groups highlighted some key areas around Branding, Member engagement, Sustainability &amp; Budgeting, Communication and Guidelines, and these are the topics that our community will be working on over the next year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second workshop dealt with ideas for plans that the working groups can make over the next year as well. Participants were split into groups of 2 to come up with ideas. Some of the great possible ideas to look out for included, Cross KIC events, “Fail Nights”, Hackathons, Island Talks, Alpine Talks and a possible Cruise!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Board also had the chance to update our leaders with the current state of working groups and to do some 1-on-1 talks with individual working group needs, as well as having checkpoints for focus group type discussions on topics to do with Partnerships, Marketing Communications, Financing and Tools / the Website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAs always, your new board is ready and eager to support you. We will be back in touch with more news soon, but in the meantime, don't hesitate to get in touch with us via alumni@eitdigital.eu :)</p>\r\n"
