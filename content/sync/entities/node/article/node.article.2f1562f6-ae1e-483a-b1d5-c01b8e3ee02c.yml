It started with an opening speech from </span><span class=\"c0\">Esmee Kooijman</span><span class=\"c1 c0\">&nbsp;(President of CKAA) &amp; Theo Xenakis (former board member of CKAA), who explained the objectives of the event and introduced the community to the newcomers. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c3\"><img alt=\"Kirsten Dunlop\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"74b245bb-fbc0-4f36-ad5e-f732fb5bf030\" src=\"/eit-digital-alumni-drupal8/sites/default/files/inline-images/47679653_1592752120824246_860950765991100416_o.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">After this brief introduction, </span><span class=\"c4 c0\">Kirsten Dunlop</span><span class=\"c0\">&nbsp;gave an inspirational speech explaining her vision on </span><span class=\"c4 c0\">how the Climate-KIC Community can play a vital role in reaching a climate-resilient society</span><span class=\"c1 c0\">. She mentioned the commitment of Climate-KIC, its mission and its major activities, concluding with the future directions to take.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">The programme followed with two high quality speeches from </span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Marshall_(environmentalist)&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182256000\">George Marshall</a></span><span class=\"c0\">&nbsp;(</span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://climateoutreach.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182256000\">Climate Outreach</a></span><span class=\"c0\">) and </span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Maxton&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182256000\">Graeme Maxton</a></span><span class=\"c0\">&nbsp;(</span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.clubofrome.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182256000\">Club of Rome</a></span><span class=\"c0\">), with a panel discussion in between. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c3\"><img alt=\"George Marshall\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"39ff71f4-50ed-43eb-92c0-3cbbb942946c\" src=\"/eit-digital-alumni-drupal8/sites/default/files/inline-images/47572785_1592751780824280_8290477931545755648_o.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">George Marshall - a British environmental campaigner, communications specialist and writer - discussed about how to <strong>carry </strong></span><span class=\"c4 c0\"><strong>communication on the field “Climate Change”</strong> in order to mobilize society</span><span class=\"c0\">; m</span><span class=\"c0\">ore specifically</span><span class=\"c0\">,</span><span class=\"c0\">&nbsp;he held a speech regarding his research findings more extensively</span><span class=\"c0\">&nbsp;described</span><span class=\"c0\">&nbsp;in his book </span><span class=\"c0\">“</span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/dont-even-think-about-it-9781620401330/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182257000\">Don’t Even </a></span><span class=\"c7 c4 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/dont-even-think-about-it-9781620401330/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182258000\">Think About it: How Our Brains are Wired to Ignore Climate Change</a></span><span class=\"c1 c0\">”. The main outcome of the speech is that most of the people think about climate change as a future problem which should be directly tackled by governments’ policies and not by single individuals, indeed the general feeling of the average citizen apparently is powerlessness. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">After a delicious veggie lunch (indeed, I’ve learned that the vegetarian diet has a lower carbon impact than meat-based diet) and a panel discussion moderated by Theo Xenakis, we had the opportunity to assist to a </span><span class=\"c4 c0\">noteworthy speech held by Graeme Maxton</span><span class=\"c1 c0\">&nbsp;- economist and best-selling author.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c3\"><img alt=\"Graeme Maxton\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ac996413-6575-449c-8223-7ce61898b1af\" src=\"/eit-digital-alumni-drupal8/sites/default/files/inline-images/48379793_1592751244157667_4127722304580878336_o.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">Graeme Maxton is the former secretary general of the </span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_of_Rome&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182259000\">Club of Rome</a></span><span class=\"c1 c0\">, whose mission is to promote understanding of the global challenges facing humanity and to propose solutions through scientific analysis, communication and advocacy.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"c0\">The talk has been a discussion around his book “</span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.graememaxton.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182259000\">Change! Why we need a radical turnaround</a></span><span class=\"c1 c0\">”.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1 c0\">He insisted that the biggest problem is that we need to <strong>act now in order to avoid future - irreparable - problems</strong>, and if the Governments or the economic system do not act in a proper way, it is up to citizens to get mobilized and create awareness. Following this vision an association like the CKAA should play a relevant role.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1 c0\">This was followed by a Community Feedback Session, with Esmee &amp; Dorka Bauer (Communication Manager of the CKAA) and Emily Swaddle (Climate-KIC): this was an open discussion on upcoming changes in the community, presenting the results from the community research and with a voting session for the alumni.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">After the feedback session a very <strong>interesting</strong></span><strong><span class=\"c0 c5\">&nbsp;workshop </span></strong><span class=\"c0\">took place, with the members of the community actively participating. The activities covered several topics such as </span><span class=\"c4 c0\">Climate Change Journalism, Sustainable Cooking or Insights into Global Climate Politics. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">Finally some success stories, presented by entrepreneurs such as Kilian Kaminski (Co-Founder &amp; CEO at </span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.refurbed.de/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182261000\">Refurbed</a></span><span class=\"c0\">, the online marketplace for refurbished electronics), who told us his experience and his motivations </span><span class=\"c0\">to lead a business with such low environmental footprint. </span><span class=\"c1 c0\">, and - after the closing remarks - we all headed to have dinner and a bit of party in the city center of Vienna. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">The following day in the morning we had some recreational activities, choosing from </span><span class=\"c4 c0\">climbing</span><span class=\"c0\">&nbsp;or a very “</span><span class=\"c4 c0\">Special City Tour</span><span class=\"c0\">”. I decided to be a tourist, but it turned out not to be a normal city tour with a standard guide. The tour was organized by </span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.shades-tours.com/en/shades-tours/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182262000\">Shade-Tours</a></span><span class=\"c0\">, an association that helps homeless people recover from that inhumane condition. Nevertheless, our guide Charles (fictitious name) was an </span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://oldtimer.wordpress.com/2007/05/21/houseless-and-homeless-not-same-thing/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182262000\">houseless</a></span><span class=\"c0\">&nbsp;(yes, houseless): he told us his story - he was a “normal” person, a doctor - things went unlucky for him</span><span class=\"c0\">. Luckily, also thanks to </span><span class=\"c0 c4\">Shade-Tours, </span><span class=\"c0\">he is now on the right track to get back to a better life. The event finished with lunch, and after I had lunch with some of my </span><span class=\"c4 c0\">“new Climate Friends”</span><span class=\"c1 c0\">&nbsp;I headed to the train station and travelled back home. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c3\"><img alt=\"Group\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"80d9e906-420c-4c55-9374-a687e26e8a83\" src=\"/eit-digital-alumni-drupal8/sites/default/files/inline-images/IMG_20181125_131942.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c3\"><strong><span class=\"c0 c5 c10\">What did I bring back home?</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c3\"><span>For sure the happiness to have met </span><span class=\"c4\">great, positive and energetic people</span><span>&nbsp;who are working &nbsp;everyday on something that has an</span><span class=\"c5\">&nbsp;i</span><span>mpact on all humans (and not only). &nbsp;Second, but not less important, I’ve learned that </span><strong><span class=\"c5\">Climate Change</span><span class=\"c5\">&nbsp;is a serious issue and a real actual problem</span></strong><span>&nbsp;which everybody should take into account in our daily life from today, not tomorrow. </span><span class=\"c5\"><strong>Little daily choices</strong> </span><span>having a good outcome, if pursued by the majority of us, </span><strong><span class=\"c5\">can have a great impact on our planet’s health</span></strong><span>.

After this warming-up session “</span><span class=\"c4 c0\">the ice has definitely been broken</span><span class=\"c1 c0\">” and we headed back to the hotel to have some rest and get ready for the next day.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><img alt=\"Esmee Kooijman\_(President of CKAA)\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d800c488-7ebd-43f8-a2e9-6dd13ce79fe9\" src=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/48228896_1592752937490831_2807597929299181568_o.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">The following day was more intense. It started with an opening speech from </span><span class=\"c0\">Esmee Kooijman</span><span class=\"c1 c0\">\_(President of CKAA) &amp; Theo Xenakis (former board member of CKAA), who explained the objectives of the event and introduced the community to the newcomers. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><img alt=\"Kirsten Dunlop\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"74b245bb-fbc0-4f36-ad5e-f732fb5bf030\" src=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/47679653_1592752120824246_860950765991100416_o.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">After this brief introduction, </span><span class=\"c4 c0\">Kirsten Dunlop</span><span class=\"c0\">\_gave an inspirational speech explaining her vision on </span><span class=\"c4 c0\">how the Climate-KIC Community can play a vital role in reaching a climate-resilient society</span><span class=\"c1 c0\">. She mentioned the commitment of Climate-KIC, its mission and its major activities, concluding with the future directions to take.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">The programme followed with two high quality speeches from </span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Marshall_(environmentalist)&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182256000\">George Marshall</a></span><span class=\"c0\">\_(</span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://climateoutreach.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182256000\">Climate Outreach</a></span><span class=\"c0\">) and </span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Maxton&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182256000\">Graeme Maxton</a></span><span class=\"c0\">\_(</span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.clubofrome.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182256000\">Club of Rome</a></span><span class=\"c0\">), with a panel discussion in between. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><img alt=\"George Marshall\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"39ff71f4-50ed-43eb-92c0-3cbbb942946c\" src=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/47572785_1592751780824280_8290477931545755648_o.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">George Marshall - a British environmental campaigner, communications specialist and writer - discussed about how to <strong>carry </strong></span><span class=\"c4 c0\"><strong>communication on the field “Climate Change”</strong> in order to mobilize society</span><span class=\"c0\">; m</span><span class=\"c0\">ore specifically</span><span class=\"c0\">,</span><span class=\"c0\">\_he held a speech regarding his research findings more extensively</span><span class=\"c0\">\_described</span><span class=\"c0\">\_in his book </span><span class=\"c0\">“</span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/dont-even-think-about-it-9781620401330/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182257000\">Don’t Even </a></span><span class=\"c7 c4 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/dont-even-think-about-it-9781620401330/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182258000\">Think About it: How Our Brains are Wired to Ignore Climate Change</a></span><span class=\"c1 c0\">”. The main outcome of the speech is that most of the people think about climate change as a future problem which should be directly tackled by governments’ policies and not by single individuals, indeed the general feeling of the average citizen apparently is powerlessness. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">After a delicious veggie lunch (indeed, I’ve learned that the vegetarian diet has a lower carbon impact than meat-based diet) and a panel discussion moderated by Theo Xenakis, we had the opportunity to assist to a </span><span class=\"c4 c0\">noteworthy speech held by Graeme Maxton</span><span class=\"c1 c0\">\_- economist and best-selling author.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><img alt=\"Graeme Maxton\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ac996413-6575-449c-8223-7ce61898b1af\" src=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/48379793_1592751244157667_4127722304580878336_o.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">Graeme Maxton is the former secretary general of the </span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_of_Rome&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182259000\">Club of Rome</a></span><span class=\"c1 c0\">, whose mission is to promote understanding of the global challenges facing humanity and to propose solutions through scientific analysis, communication and advocacy.\_</span><span class=\"c0\">The talk has been a discussion around his book “</span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.graememaxton.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182259000\">Change! Why we need a radical turnaround</a></span><span class=\"c1 c0\">”.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1 c0\">He insisted that the biggest problem is that we need to <strong>act now in order to avoid future - irreparable - problems</strong>, and if the Governments or the economic system do not act in a proper way, it is up to citizens to get mobilized and create awareness. Following this vision an association like the CKAA should play a relevant role.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1 c0\">This was followed by a Community Feedback Session, with Esmee &amp; Dorka Bauer (Communication Manager of the CKAA) and Emily Swaddle (Climate-KIC): this was an open discussion on upcoming changes in the community, presenting the results from the community research and with a voting session for the alumni.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">After the feedback session a very <strong>interesting</strong></span><strong><span class=\"c0 c5\">\_workshop </span></strong><span class=\"c0\">took place, with the members of the community actively participating. The activities covered several topics such as </span><span class=\"c4 c0\">Climate Change Journalism, Sustainable Cooking or Insights into Global Climate Politics. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">Finally some success stories, presented by entrepreneurs such as Kilian Kaminski (Co-Founder &amp; CEO at </span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.refurbed.de/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182261000\">Refurbed</a></span><span class=\"c0\">, the online marketplace for refurbished electronics), who told us his experience and his motivations </span><span class=\"c0\">to lead a business with such low environmental footprint. </span><span class=\"c1 c0\">, and - after the closing remarks - we all headed to have dinner and a bit of party in the city center of Vienna. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">The following day in the morning we had some recreational activities, choosing from </span><span class=\"c4 c0\">climbing</span><span class=\"c0\">\_or a very “</span><span class=\"c4 c0\">Special City Tour</span><span class=\"c0\">”. I decided to be a tourist, but it turned out not to be a normal city tour with a standard guide. The tour was organized by </span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.shades-tours.com/en/shades-tours/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182262000\">Shade-Tours</a></span><span class=\"c0\">, an association that helps homeless people recover from that inhumane condition. Nevertheless, our guide Charles (fictitious name) was an </span><span class=\"c7 c0\"><a class=\"c6\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://oldtimer.wordpress.com/2007/05/21/houseless-and-homeless-not-same-thing/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544872182262000\">houseless</a></span><span class=\"c0\">\_(yes, houseless): he told us his story - he was a “normal” person, a doctor - things went unlucky for him</span><span class=\"c0\">. Luckily, also thanks to </span><span class=\"c0 c4\">Shade-Tours, </span><span class=\"c0\">he is now on the right track to get back to a better life. The event finished with lunch, and after I had lunch with some of my </span><span class=\"c4 c0\">“new Climate Friends”</span><span class=\"c1 c0\">\_I headed to the train station and travelled back home. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><img alt=\"Group\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"80d9e906-420c-4c55-9374-a687e26e8a83\" src=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/IMG_20181125_131942.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><strong><span class=\"c0 c5 c10\">What did I bring back home?</span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"c3\"><span>For sure the happiness to have met </span><span class=\"c4\">great, positive and energetic people</span><span>\_who are working \_everyday on something that has an</span><span class=\"c5\">\_i</span><span>mpact on all humans (and not only). \_Second, but not less important, I’ve learned that </span><strong><span class=\"c5\">Climate Change</span><span class=\"c5\">\_is a serious issue and a real actual problem</span></strong><span>\_which everybody should take into account in our daily life from today, not tomorrow. </span><span class=\"c5\"><strong>Little daily choices</strong> </span><span>having a good outcome, if pursued by the majority of us, </span><strong><span class=\"c5\">can have a great impact on our planet’s health</span></strong><span>.
