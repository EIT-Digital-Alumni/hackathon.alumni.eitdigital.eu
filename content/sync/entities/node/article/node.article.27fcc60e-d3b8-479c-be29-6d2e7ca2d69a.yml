    value: "<p><a href=\"https://drivetrust.eu/\">DriveTrust</a>, now an H2020 funded startup based in Rennes, France, was started from an idea of <a href=\"https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/users/romrayster\">Roman Prytkov</a> and <a href=\"https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/users/tolgavarol\">Tolga Varol</a>&nbsp;had&nbsp;when they were in an EIT Digital Summer School.

For example,&nbsp;Drivers shall be alerted if they appear to be sleepy or aggressive on the trip.&nbsp;Car sharing&nbsp;companies, such as DriveNow and OuiCar, can better monitor car usage by its driver behaviour measurement. Furthermore, insurance agencies could tailor their policy by anonymised historical driving data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They wrap the idea to a product in a few levels. A computer-vision-based hardware solution&nbsp;can record and analyse driving behaviours and transmit recording or analytics over LTE/Wifi/Bluetooth and V2X (vehicle to everything) in the future. A dashboard containing data analytics is offered to evaluate and educate driving.
