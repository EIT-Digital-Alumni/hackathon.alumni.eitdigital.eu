    value: "<p>I attended the <a href=\"https://eitalumni.eu/blog/2018/12/11/intelligent-alumni-artificial-intelligence-workshop/\">Legal and Regulatory Implication of Artificial Intelligence Workshop in Brussels</a> on the 23rd of November 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm <a href=\"https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/users/dpribil\" target=\"_blank\">David </a>and I'm an EIT Digital Alumnus. After attending the <a href=\"https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/event/eit-alumni-connect-2018\">2018 EIT Alumni Connect</a>&nbsp;in Budapest, I was contacted by the Alumni network and offered an opportunity to participate in this event - and since I'm working on AI solutions in healthcare, I happily accepted it.<br />\r\n<img alt=\"David\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c0f137be-c02a-4827-8c67-3816cf2b04c9\" src=\"/eit-digital-alumni-drupal8/sites/default/files/inline-images/david1.jpg\" /><br />\r\nI travelled from London to Brussels via Eurostar on the 22nd. I was yet again amazed by how more convenient it is to travel with trains compared to flights - no rushing to the airport and getting from the centre of London to the centre of Brussels in 2 hours. It was great!&nbsp;There was some time for a bit of sightseeing around La Grand Place in the evening,&nbsp;to drink some Belgian beers in this great pub, \"A La Mort Subite\", and&nbsp;for more sightseeing around Mont des Arts. After walking around Brussels, I went back to the hotel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>The Workshop</strong></span><br />\r\nThe event took place in the EIT House, a 30-minute&nbsp;walk away from the hotel. I saw this on the way, it was a great inspirational message before getting there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Europe\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"affd16e1-4870-4650-a38c-a91187460c82\" src=\"/eit-digital-alumni-drupal8/sites/default/files/inline-images/david5.jpg\" /><br />\r\nThis event was mostly tailored for people working on the regulatory and legal field. Based on the conversations I had with other participants there weren't too many people from the <strong>industry</strong>. So I took this as an opportunity and talked as much as I could from a practical standpoint about <strong>GDPR</strong> and how it affects research, partnerships and small businesses in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event consisted of two sections. The first section was a series of presentations regarding certain <strong>data protection and regulatory topics</strong>. All the presentations can be downloaded <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/event/workshop/legal-and-regulatory-implications-artificial-intelligence-ai\">here</a>. The second section was the <strong>workshop</strong>, where we raised issues regarding data protection regulations in Europe and could come up with suggestions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Challenges &amp; solutions</strong></span><br />\r\nAll of us had the chance to post and discuss challenges on the whiteboard. Then, these challenges were clustered into larger categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"David\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"74b1dfc0-331e-4f4c-a2c4-e968edbb99e4\" src=\"/eit-digital-alumni-drupal8/sites/default/files/inline-images/david6.jpg\" /><br />\r\nThen we had a chance to post potential solutions (in orange). Not surprisingly coming up with solutions is much harder than stating problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"David\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b73659a8-a8af-40f4-8d65-ad1a906d6c04\" src=\"/eit-digital-alumni-drupal8/sites/default/files/inline-images/david7.jpg\" /><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Back to London &amp; final note</strong></span><br />\r\nAfter the workshop, I took the metro back to the train station to catch my train back to London.
