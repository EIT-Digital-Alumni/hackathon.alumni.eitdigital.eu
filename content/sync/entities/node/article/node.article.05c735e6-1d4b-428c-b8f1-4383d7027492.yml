During the course of a restructured and redesigned 12 hour hackathon over 25 participants were invited to tackle the tricky challenge of re-imagining the port of Badalona. A challenge fraught with multiple difficulties and dimensions, but one which ultimately offers the chance to make your mark on Catalonian history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EIT Alumni Startup Days are one of the flagship events for the EIT Alumni Community.
