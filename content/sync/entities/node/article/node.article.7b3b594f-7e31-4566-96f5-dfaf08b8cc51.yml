    value: "<p>We - at EIT Digital Alumni - have recently celebrated the first anniversary of <a href=\"https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/mentorship-programme\">our mentorship programme</a>: this was <a href=\"https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/article/mentorship-programme\">launched&nbsp;at the end of 2017</a> and has turned 1 now receiving an overwhelmingly <strong>positive response</strong>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI, <a href=\"https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/users/shikhar-singh\">Shikhar Singh</a>,&nbsp;hail from India and&nbsp;graduated from the EIT Digital Master School in <strong>2016</strong> in the Distributed Systems track. I am now working as a Project Lead. EIT Digital has had a tremendous influence on me from the moment I signed up for the programme in the <strong>summer of 2014</strong>. The support for me from EIT Digital, my entry university and the then enrolled students was overwhelming. I had never travelled outside of my country before this, let alone live abroad. And I don’t think it would have been possible to survive in Europe without this support. And hence when I graduated, I felt a strong <a href=\"https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/how-can-i-contribute\">urge both to give back</a><strong> </strong>to the EIT Digital community and <strong>help out students</strong> in similar situation as I was:&nbsp;the answer to this need&nbsp;was a <strong>Mentor-Mentee programme</strong>.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nI immediately got in contact with the Alumni Board, who couldn’t have been more assuring and supportive. Since a Mentorship programme was one of the points on their agenda, they&nbsp;fully backed the idea of having a bottom-up initiative where <strong>alumni come together to guide and mentor younger members</strong>.
