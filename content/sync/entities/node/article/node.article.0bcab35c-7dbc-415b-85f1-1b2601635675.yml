Not only have we continued our growth - both in terms of members and initiatives - but we have also significantly <strong>strengthened our whole network</strong>, by better defining our structure of bottom-up <a href=\"https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/groups\">Local Communities</a>, spearheaded by our passionate Teams. Meanwhile, we have delivered an unforgettable second <a href=\"http://bit.ly/aftermovie18\">Annual Meeting</a> and amplified our visibility and recognition toward the whole EIT (Digital) ecosystem.
