    value: '<p>Ever since I have started my EIT Digital journey in 2015, the idea had been brewing in my mind how one day I could do something similar and contribute to the Community. Back in 2015&nbsp;it was an EIT sponsored outreach (now ARISE) programme that had given me an opportunity to attend a winter school in Trento which changed my life forever. Four years have passed and my passion only grew, both academically and&nbsp;enthusiastically with each activity. Two Summer schools, two Winter schools, three Kick-offs, two Ambassador trainings, two Innovation days, two continents, many conferences and an incredible network of connections. All throughout this time I have witnessed&nbsp;EIT Digital ALUMNI elected Board govern under different Presidents&nbsp;- from&nbsp;Borče, to Francesco and currently Jeroen''s mandate. Becoming an EIT Digital ALUMNUS&nbsp;also meant that I could finally be a voice of a&nbsp;wonderful community and this opportunity to&nbsp;compete in an Extraordinary Board Elections is extraordinary and special&nbsp;to me as well. Attracting new opportunities for my extended EIT Digital family, strengthening cross-KIC collaborations, getting familiar with branchy EU structures and deciphering our shared interconnected, intercultural, global future is everything that makes my heart and mind filled with creative, wild new ideas. I believe in bringing hope to the idea of strong EIT Digital and hence - stronger Europe. Balancing responsibilities, facing challenges, communicating with potential partners and having a laugh even when swamped with work&nbsp;is a combination I am ready for.</p>'

Empowering ARISE countries and partners is also something I would like to discuss with EIT Governing Board member Ana Trbović.<br><br>Moreover, during my time as a participant&nbsp;at EIT Digital Conference, I have stayed in contact with directorates of newly created EIT Digital Satellite locations (such as Edinburgh in Scotland and their strong afinity towards security and privacy sector). In addition, my past summer period was spent attending many EIT sponsored summer schools where I have expanded my network in Den Haag (NATO),&nbsp;München (politics and policy making), Bruxelles&nbsp;(European Commission) and others. All of this could be utilized to strengthen the under-represented EIT Digital tracks (cyber security and visual computing) and make them more popular amongst future generations.

Moreover, I would be happy to bring the culture and mindset of this far-away hubs closer to our students in Europe. This should be done soon as we are witnessing a rapid&nbsp;expansion of EIT outside&nbsp;EU borders (Tel Aviv in Israel). An additional idea I had for connecting audience with our digital world in a comprehensible way&nbsp;would be to intertwine this&nbsp;with a long dream of&nbsp;mine to open a personal&nbsp;YouTube channel.<br><br>I would like to encourage people to participate in hackathons, workshops or EIT sponsored summer schools&nbsp;and be active, this could be done by creating a simple map in collaboration with future Technology Officer&nbsp;of such events categorized by time and financial details.<br><br>As I can speak or understand a number of different&nbsp;slavic languages in addition to non-slavic ones I''ve learned while travelling around, I can bring more social cohesion when interacting with the Community. Not to forget, I am currently doing my additional studies in IT management and leadership so I will be more flexible when it comes to ALUMNI calls and meetings, events. For the most part, I will be spending the entire next year of 2020 being based&nbsp;in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 2021, Copenhagen will also be my harbour until possibly moving shortly for 3 months to California, Los Angeles and San Francisco.<br><br>Giving back to the Community, staying true to myself, passionately pursuing dreams and having a great dynamic with EIT Digital ALUMNI Board is something I very much look forward to.</p>'
