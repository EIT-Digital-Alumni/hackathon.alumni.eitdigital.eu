    value: '<p>Since I joined one of the EIT Digital summer schools in 2015 (and later became full master''s student in 2016), I have had the opportunity to meet many of members of our community: Current students, alumni, staff, friends of EIT Digital and people from other EIT KICs. I do not exaggerate when I say it was one of the best decisions I have ever taken, which has allowed me to develop as a professional and as a person. It would not be crazy either to say that most of this learning has occurred thanks to the people that I have met along the way: Three summer schools, four kick-off events, two&nbsp;annual alumni meetings, many local meet-ups and counting... What was the core platform that enabled such interactions? The EVENTS, of course!</p>'

The outgoing board has done an outstanding work scaling up the community and building a strong base to enable new courses of action. Now it is a priority for the next board to <u>set up a more structured framework</u>, which allows us to implement and replicate further kinds of activities that allow to leverage on each other''s strengths, as well as to improve the recognition and strategic positioning of the EIT Digital Alumni at the European and international level. Based on my <a href="https://ayy.fi/en/profiles/esn-aalto/" target="_blank">previous experiences volunteering</a> for one of the largest non-profit student associations, the <a href="https://esn.org/about" target="_blank">Erasmus Student Network (ESN)</a>, I am familiar with the challenges and opportunities ahead.

Regarding the latter, as the number of registered alumni increases, I consider critical to <u>strengthen the role of the local groups</u>. We need to gradually move away from the top-down delegation of event responsibilities assigned to a single local representative per location. Instead, we should transition toward the development of more stable groups of frequent volunteers, who are sufficiently empowered to lead, propose and organize their own events and activities. These bottom-up intiatives from volunteer groups will help us address the specific concerns and interests of their local communities, such as facilitating cultural integration and providing support in matters of daily working life. I propose launching an early consultation process with the local groups to identify common and location-specific topics of interest, trying to bring more attention into places that have not been considered traditionally as hosts of&nbsp;EIT Digital events (for example, cities without a co-location center or CLC).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Increasing partnerships</strong></div><div>The board should also provide the required support for local groups to <u>encourage the collaboration with relevant companies and research centers</u>, turning any occasional joint activities into more permanent/long-term partnerships or sponsorships for the benefit of our members.

I believe that continuous, life-long learning is essential for IT professionals in our era. Luckily, our alumni possess advanced knowledge and perform important work positions inside industry and academia. Therefore, we should make a priority that we can keep learning from each other through non-formal training, workshops and networking events. If the EIT Digital education programs focus on <em>"deep tech"</em>, the EIT Digital Alumni foundation shall provide a great opportunity to continue developing the&nbsp;<em>"deep people"</em> skills of our members permanently. In this aspect, we can reinforce current initatives by some of our alumni like the <a href="https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/mentorship-programme" target="_blank">mentorship program</a> or the&nbsp;<a href="https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/mastermind-group" target="_blank">mastermind groups</a>, so besides running just as standalone projects, they could&nbsp;be promoted as "themes" or "causes" blended into the agenda in some of the local groups'' events.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Reflecting our diversity</strong></div><div>We are also a community of professionals working in different&nbsp;fields, regardless of country of origin and gender.

This could be a good opportunity to create a more transparent process, with <u>open call for candidate location</u> and organizing committees (OC), with funding provided by the board according to the OC’s budget proposal. In other words, it would be our alumni members themselves the ones to propose where and how the Annual Meeting would be organized. After all, it is the members residing in the host locations who know best about the local prices, required logistics and potential sponsors, so this idea can help us organize such demanding events in a more efficient way.
