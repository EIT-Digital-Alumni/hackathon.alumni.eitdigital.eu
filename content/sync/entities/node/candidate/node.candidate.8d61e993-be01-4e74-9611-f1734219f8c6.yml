    value: '<p>Whilst studying in Stockholm I was part of the Create Squared, Sweden''s biggest sustainable business model Hackathon for students, I worked as the Co-IT manager. Although my sole responsibility on paper was to manage the website, sales tickets and technology used during the event. Due&nbsp;to a greater need from the Outreach Manager, I also became co- Outreach Manager to locate the best partnerships for the event. This was really where I was able to help spread my knowledge of the event and the need for a hackathon for all students, from the business and technology side. During the event, I was able to ensure that everyone was well managed and connecting those who either did not have a team or were looking for someone specific to aid where they perhaps lacked skills. Making people feel welcomed and open to make the connections is something I really strived towards creating during this event. Seeing what ideas were created during the weekend&nbsp;demonstrates that this was indeed successful. Connecting with people about a specific topic or idea they are&nbsp;passionate about is something that has always been fun and motivating for me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst also at KTH I ran workshops with KTH Giants, a workshop weekend trying to get more teenage girls into STEM, specifically for littleBits. This was a great way to communicate about technology in simple terms. Creating the workshop material from scratch allowed me to gain a better sense of the work that is involved with such events in learning environments. I was also in charge of the KTH Instagram for a week where a weekly agenda and planning was needed to show the users most about what being a student was like in Swedens capital. Connecting with people watching all over the world was key in keeping the week fun but also learning to communicate via online through social media.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wanting to stay connected and motivated in the EIT community, I found the position of the Outreach &amp; Partnerships Officer most attractive and can really see myself not only in the role but see it as great opportunity to connect with those companies that the EIT community is either lacking in or strengthen the ties we already have!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Moving to Aalto for the second year I lost this means of connecting with people (event-specific) as I was so stressed with trying to find a thesis and connect with the companies here in Finland, which before seemed so easy when behind the name of a project. Learning this new way of communication and way to collaborate with companies was great to help enhance my means of approachment and really understand that not all situations are the same.

    value: '<p>I would love for you to vote for me as&nbsp;I really think I can help add value to the already existing&nbsp; EIT Alumni Community and board and would be a great Outreach &amp; Partnerships Officer. I am a fun-loving communicator with a passion for making everyone in the room feel welcome! Living in multiple countries throughout my life I learned to understand the means of communication, verbal and non and that not all cultures may be as accepting of a talkative as an international Canadian. I love connecting people at events and learning more about each &amp; everyone in the EIT community. We are all so different yet alike and showcasing that by means of outreach and partnership can really help make the EIT Alumni Community something everyone will want to be apart of! I am hoping that my words have made me seem adaptable, approachable yet creative enough for this position. If I were to be elected I cannot do it without everyone! I would love to hear about who we, as a community, would want to connect with and where we would like it to go. Always here to understand what the people want :)</p>'
