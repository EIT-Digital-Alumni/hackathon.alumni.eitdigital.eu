    value: '<p>I have decided to apply for the position of President of the EIT Digital Alumni, since I would like to continue the impressive development our community has gone through in the past 300+ days. After serving for a whole year as Marketing &amp; Communications Officer, I''d love to have a chance to take the lead of our young environment and drive it to a further step. My vision is that - in a few years - we will not only be a group of "graduates of the educational programmes of EIT Digital", but a network of young and senior professionals who - for different reasons and at different times - crossed their paths with EIT Digital, and still want to be involved in the ecosystem, because they believe in its goal, understand its potential and know they could benefit from being part of it in an active and positive way.</p>'
