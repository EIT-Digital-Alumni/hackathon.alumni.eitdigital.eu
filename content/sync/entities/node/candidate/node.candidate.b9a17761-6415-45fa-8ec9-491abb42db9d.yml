Motivated by the same feeling, I built the Alumni mentorship program in the EIT-Digital community. In this program we have a network of more than 55 Alumni who act as a mentor to current students and help them with all sorts of questions. My experience leading the Alumni mentorship program has been amazing and this serves another motivation for me to be involved in the community more heavily.
