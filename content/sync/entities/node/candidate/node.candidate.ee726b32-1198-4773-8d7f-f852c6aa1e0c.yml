Secondly I''ve been inundated with requests from potential students trying to find more information and guidance about the programme. This position will give me a chance to address the issues better and bring more engaging students and prospective partners to our community.</p>'

E.g. a single point of contact of a person working in Automation testing in some Berlin-based startup becomes a node point for the Alumni cell. A network of many such connections will be a win-win for the cell and the employee. The alumni cell will be able to help its member students find appopriate places for work, offer guidance in finding new opportunities, and the nodal employee stay up to date with emerging talent and work among its contemporaries.</p>'
