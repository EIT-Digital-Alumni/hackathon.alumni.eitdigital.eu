    value: "<p>We are looking for a talented and motivated <strong>PhD student</strong> having an MSc or MEng (4y BEng will be considered) in computer science, statistics, maths, electrical engineering, or a related field to join the <a href=\"http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/prospective-students/courses/phd/\" target=\"_blank\">Computation Privacy Group</a> (CPG) at <strong>Imperial College London</strong>.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will be working on a research project in applied machine learning in collaboration with EDF Energy and the <a href=\"https://www.bregroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BRE group</a>. The goal is to build a user’s profile of energy consumption from smartmeter data, with applications to behavioral identification learning, anomaly detection (change in behavior), and as learned user representation to be re-used in other ML applications. For instance, we would aim to infer customer information such as gender or socio-demographic status. We plan to start with simple learned similarity metrics before developing deep learning techniques designed for smart meter data. Being the Computational Privacy Group, we hope to ultimately design ways for this data to be properly anonymized and shared.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe CPG is a very dynamic and diverse research group. Our work tackles the definition of formal properties and metrics of privacy or fairness in algorithmic decision-making, the development of privacy-enhancing data processing systems, and the development of machine learning techniques for behavioral user fingerprinting. Projects by the group often include a mix of theoretical and empirical work with large-scale data from mobile phones, credit card transactions, browsers, etc. sometimes in collaboration with industry partners. All our projects aim to generate significant real-world impact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <strong>deadline</strong> for submitting the application is <strong>22nd March 2019</strong>.&nbsp;<br />\r\nIf you are interested, send an email with your CV and transcript to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:demontjoye@imperial.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\">demontjoye@imperial.ac.uk</a>.</p>\r\n"
