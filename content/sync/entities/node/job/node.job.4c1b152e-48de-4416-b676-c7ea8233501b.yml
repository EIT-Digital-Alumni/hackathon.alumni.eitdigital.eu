    value: "<p>The <a href=\"https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk\">Computational Privacy Group at Imperial College London</a> (Data Science Institute), directed by Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, has funded openings for <strong>PhD students</strong> to work on topics related to privacy, machine learning, re-identification/anonymization algorithms, privacy-enhancing technologies, and ethics and fairness in AI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the group we are all very young and passionate about our research. We are open to applicants from a broad range of backgrounds (Math, Physics, CS, Engineering,...). If you are interested, please read the complete description below and get in touch with us.<br />\r\n<strong>*Deadline for applications is Nov 9, 2018.*</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is our website: http://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk</p>\r\n\r\n<p>----------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first time in history, we have the ability to amass massive amounts of data about humans and the societies in which we live. Data generated by our technologies has the potential to fundamentally transform the way we fight diseases, design transportation systems, and develop new drugs. Improperly used, this data can lead to deep violations of our privacy and large-scale discrimination. The goal of our work is to develop research and technical solutions allowing data to be used for good in a privacy-conscientious and fair manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Projects are defined in close collaboration with the student but could, e.g., tackle the definition of formal properties and metrics of privacy or fairness in algorithmic decision-making, the development of privacy-enhancing data processing systems, and the development of machine learning techniques for behavioral user fingerprinting. Projects by the group often include a mix of theoretical and empirical work with large-scale data from mobile phones, credit card transactions, browsers, etc. sometimes in collaboration with industry partners. All projects at the institute aim to generate significant real-world impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidates are expected to have an <strong>MSc or MEng</strong> (4y BEng will be considered) in computer science, statistics, maths, electrical engineering, or a related field. Experience in data science and machine learning is encouraged. A full-time PhD at Imperial College will normally take 3-4 years and is fully funded (tuition + stipend). Most students start in October but a January start is possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/prospective-students/courses/phd/\">Applications are centralized HERE</a>&nbsp;but prospective candidates are encouraged to <strong>email deMontjoye@imperial.ac.uk</strong> with a CV (incl. grades) before the deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About Imperial: Consistently rated amongst the world's best universities (8th globally in the QS World University Rankings, 9th in the THE World University Rankings and most innovative university in Europe in Reuter), Imperial College London is a science-based institution with a reputation for excellence in teaching and research.
