    value: "<p>We share with you <strong>two projects</strong> that require a team member that is capable of developing the relevant software <strong>\"IoT\" system</strong>. There is funding for 6 months starting from July <strong>(1500€/month)</strong> followed by <strong>2500€/month from month 7</strong>. The location of the projects is Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following, please find the project descriptions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Project 1:</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Smart Cloud Farming</strong>&nbsp;is a real-time surveillance system for monitoring conditions on a field for crops. Relevant production/ growth parameters (soil: water, nutrients; plant: biotic and abiotic stress factors; environment: weather, eco system services; market: supply and demand, economic, political and social trends) will be captured with modern sensor technologies in real time. The collected data will be send to a cloud system, analysed and translated to a recommendation for action which is specifically adjusted to the situation and location of the measurement.&nbsp;Thanks to this system an increase in yield and resource performance and efficiency can be achieved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Project 2:</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Monitorfish</strong>&nbsp;works on a cloud-based fish monitoring system to improve the fish yield in aqua farms. It monitors and processes the real-time onsite pond data to control water quality and diagnose fish illness. Our proprietary cloud analytic tool: AnWat, enables an on-demand analysis for fish health and water parameters that can be accessed via a mobile app. The critical variables such as water quality parameters, fish movements, positions and behaviour pattern are captured at real time via sensor networks and digital image processing in the ponds. Based on the analysis of real-time data with available fish telemetry data, machine learning models are built and trained to diagnose fish illness and optimum water quality. Finally, the users are provided with an easy to use mobile interface through which results are presented through appropriate visualisations and message alert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested or think this could be relevant for someone in your network please refer to&nbsp;dominikewald@gmail.com.</p>\r\n"
