    value: "<p>A fully-funded PhD studentship is available in the areas of Human-Computer Interaction and Persuasive Computing at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. The studentship will cover tuition fees and maintenance costs. The successful candidate is expected to start in September 2018.&nbsp;Deadline for applicants: 30th of June 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Research topic</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years behavioral economics research has revealed that people make systematic mistakes in decision making. We fail in predictable ways not because we lack knowledge, practice, or willingness, but because we are limited in the way we make decisions: our brains are tricked by “forces” that influence us (e.g., emotions, relativity, social norms, etc.). However, we are not helpless. Once we understand when and where we might make erroneous decisions, we can force ourselves to think differently. Technology can play a major role in “empowering” users to overcome their natural limitations and embrace more rational and healthier behaviors.&nbsp;The goal of this research is to develop and compare different technological interventions and measure long-term their ability to provoke positive changes in the life of the users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the application domain of this research is supporting users during the life-changing event related to&nbsp;entering and exiting from unemployment. Getting the unemployed back into work is an important policy agenda and the central mandate for employment agencies. Yet the tools available to employment agencies do not help much in one key task that job seekers need to solve: applying to the right vacancy. Solving this task is challenging since many job seekers experience anxiety and stress, which reduce working memory and impair decisions, affecting their capacity to learn from their own experience. Also, job seekers may procrastinate job search, and not search sufficiently strongly. The goal of this research will be to design a technological intervention to support job seekers during this challenging time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Supervisor</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The successful candidate will be supervised by Prof. Mauro Cherubini. He joined the University of Lausanne, in 2016. Prior to that, he worked as a Research Scientist at Google in Zurich and at Telefónica Research in Barcelona. He received his PhD in Computer Science from the Swiss Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) in 2008. Before his time at EPFL, he conducted research at the MIT Media Lab in Boston.
