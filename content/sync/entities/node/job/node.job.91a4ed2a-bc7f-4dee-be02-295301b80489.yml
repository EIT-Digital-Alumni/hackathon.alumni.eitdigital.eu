    value: "<p>At Gapminder we fight devastating ignorance with a fact-based world view anyone can understand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We identify the worst misconceptions the public has about the world, and seek to replace them with a fact-based worldview. To do this, we gather reliable data about global development and communicate it to people in ways that are fun and easy to understand. We bring data and statistics to life, by telling stories behind the data with visualizations. We collaborate with universities, UN, public agencies and non-governmental organizations, and we are an independent Swedish foundation with no political, religious or economic affiliations. You might know us from our <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/search?cat=people&amp;q=gapminder\">TED talks</a> or the book <a href=\"https://www.gapminder.org/factfulness-book/\">Factfulness</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are in an exciting phase at Gapminder, where we are exploring new and expanded products to provide the public, organizations and stakeholders with more tools for a fact-based world view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What you will do</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big part of being able to expand, is having a stable and scalable back-end architecture which we build our tools and products upon. We are looking for a senior person that is ready to dive in hands on and help develop this, as well as lead our team of developers and data engineers in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On our <a href=\"https://www.gapminder.org/tools/\">Tools Page</a> we publish advanced data visualizations, fed by statistics from many different data sources. We plan to expand this page to serve a much larger amount of statistics and a public service where people can easily visualize, and possibly store, their own data. This requires a scalable backend architecture which we hope you will help us build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, we are looking for someone to improve our ETL processes, where we gather data from organizations like World Bank, UN, WHO and IHME, transform them to our <a href=\"https://open-numbers.github.io/ddf.html\">own data format</a> and load them to our <a href=\"https://github.com/open-numbers/\">Open Numbers</a> GitHub organization and into the <a href=\"https://github.com/Gapminder/big-waffle/\">DBMS feeding our visualizations</a>. This includes further defining our data format and API's and designing and developing the processes for our ETL pipeline, including scrapers, data QA, versioning, publishing and aligning the system with our manually curated datasets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we enter into new projects, you may be involved to contribute in them too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>In short</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;- Build a scalable backend architecture for serving statistical data<br />\r\n&nbsp;-&nbsp;Improve design and implementation of data format and ETL pipelines<br />\r\n&nbsp;-&nbsp;Team management</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our visualizations and database wrapper are written in JavaScript, with the database being MariaDB (a MySQL fork). Our ETL pipelines are written in Python, heavily using the pandas library for data transformation and Apache Airflow for scheduling. Our servers are hosted on GCP. Experience with, but even more so interest in, most of these technologies is a requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for a hands on developer with leadership skills, that are comfortable leading development, including requirements gathering. We believe you have a user-centered approach to development. You have a healthy aversion to over-engineering and have no problem with getting up to speed with someone elseâ€™s code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experience with project management and building testing practices in a team is a plus.
