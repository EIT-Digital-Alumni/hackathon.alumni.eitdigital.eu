    value: "<p><strong>MASTER THESIS</strong>: EVENT-DRIVEN DISTRIBUTED ALGORITHM BASED ON BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR THE AGGREGATION OF DISTRIBUTED FLEXIBLE RESOURCES</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Company description</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://flexidao.com\">FlexiDAO</a> is a start-up based in Barcelona. We provide the industry’s first blockchain and cloud-based energy services aggregation platform to enable distributed, small-scale demand side response. Combined with our innovative electric vehicle smart charger, our platform can control and optimize EV charging providing extra income for the drivers while helping energy companies to stabilize the grid and consume more green energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leveraging blockchain technology, our platform is extremely interoperable and it can integrate different EV manufacturers, other distributed loads (i.e. home batteries), utilities, and other commercial energy partners. In addition, we can eliminate nearly all administrative and financial costs higher rewards to our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your responsibilities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you interested in the energy sector and in the blockchain world? Do you have a strong background in coding, modelling &amp; simulations? We are looking for an intern to join our core development team. If you can bring enthusiasm and knowledge, we can offer the opportunity to work on the development of our algorithm for the scheduling and aggregation of electric vehicles. Your main tasks will be the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Work in close collaboration with our developing team to contribute to the development and optimization of our algorithm;<br />\r\n-&nbsp;Perform simulation and comparison of different (centralized, distributed, hybrid, aggregate and dispatch) logics’ compatibility with hardware and technological constraints;<br />\r\n-&nbsp;Build a complex use-case scenario for the deployment of the algorithm in real-life mutli-agent simulation environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Job requirements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for a multi-talented engineer, who is excited to join our mission-oriented, friendly and fast-paced start-up environment. You should have a strong background in coding skills (especially python and NodeJS), modelling &amp; simulations. Technical knowledge about the electric vehicles aggregation and more in general the energy sector is not required. Our team is small which means you need to be independent, but you will not be asked to carry out boring tasks and you will learn a lot. You do not need to have a background in Solidity or smart contracts, but having a general knowledge about blockchain technology and decentralized system architectures is a plus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>REQUIRED SKILLS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Python<br />\r\n-&nbsp;NodeJS<br />\r\n-&nbsp;Great and fun team player, yet able to take your responsibility and work independently<br />\r\n-&nbsp;Comfortable with deadline pressures<br />\r\n-&nbsp;Fluent in English</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EXPERIENCE +</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Hands-on experience with blockchain applications<br />\r\n-&nbsp;Solid background in energy engineering and energy markets<br />\r\n-&nbsp;Java, C++</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our offer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An opportunity to work within a young, multicultural, entrepreneurial (and awesome) team that aims to contribute to the decentralization of the electrical grid to sustain the fight against climate change in one of the most amazing, sunny and hot European cities.
