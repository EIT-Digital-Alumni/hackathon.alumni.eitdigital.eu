Now is your chance to spend the summer around what you love the most: building data-driven and intelligent software in one of the Finland’s greatest new age digital agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your summer will consist of project work either in one of our external client projects or in an internal development project - or perhaps a bit of both. You will be working alongside an experienced cross disciplinary team to learn the secrets of modern software consulting and machine learning. In previous years our summer workers have worked in projects e.g. finding correlations between drugs and illness on a big dataset of web discussions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon’t worry, we don’t expect you to know everything beforehand. You will be mentored by a senior data scientist to maximize your learning and growth and to ensure you get the most out of your Futurice experience. The main expectation for you is to be willing and able to learn a lot. If you’re up for it, there may be a possibility to continue Futurice career after the summer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere’s a little checklist to help you figure out if we are a match for each other</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- You have most of your relevant programming studies behind you and your graduation may be lurking around the corner, or have otherwise got a hold of things well enough because of your passion for data science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- You have already done some data analytics or implemented data-driven program.
