    value: "<p>Professors do not understand the needs of their students. This makes effective teaching difficult. We help professors understand students better, through simple and effective feedback tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teaching evaluations have not changed since they were invented in the 1920s. Education providers around the world rely on outdated surveys that yield little to no insights. Amid the changing educational landscape, institutions come under pressure to improve their offering. Cheaper, more relevant digital approaches challenge the traditional way of education. We help educators, no matter their background, gain a better understanding of student needs through simple and effective feedback tools. CLAY is designed to be easy to use, by ditching traditional surveys in favour of a more innovative approach. CLAY is effective by presenting the results most intuitively and constructively to teachers, to increase the likelihood of teachers changing in response to feedback. We have recently won an Innovation Prize from ESCP Business School and will start testing with 15 educational institutions (mostly universities) world wide in around 3 months (e.g. in negotiations with SKEMA, NYU and HWR).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are a team of two developers, one designer and one guy for the rest (thats me, Christoph). We are looking for a user experience researcher and user experience designer on a freelance basis to conceptualise and design the feedback interface for professors. We are open to all backgrounds and interested in seeing whether you fit into the team. Get in touch if you want to innovate the world of education!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>chris@clay.it</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Posted by Alumni Member:&nbsp;<a href=\"/users/pietro93\">Pietro</a></p>\r\n"
