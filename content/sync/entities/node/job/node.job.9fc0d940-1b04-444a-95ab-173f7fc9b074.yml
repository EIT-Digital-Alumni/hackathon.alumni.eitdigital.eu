    value: "<p>The University of Alcalá (UAH) and the University Rey Juan Carlos (URJC) are pleased to announce that <strong>up to seventeen (17) fellowships</strong> are available as part of the GOT ENERGY TALENT – COFUND Fellowship programme (GET-COFUND). <strong>Out the 17 fellowships, 8/9 fellows will be recruited by the UAH and 8/9 by the URJC.</strong> The GETCOFUND fellowships are jointly funded by the University of Alcalá (UAH) and the University Rey Juan Carlos (URJC), on the one hand, and the European Union through the Marie Skłodowska-Curie COFUND scheme (Grant Agreement 754382), on the other hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fellowships will provide the opportunity for experienced researchers from around the world to spend two years in Madrid, developing their independent research and undertaking training which will help them develop into the next generation of research leaders. Fellows can decide whether to carry out a 24-month advanced research project at the academic host institution (UAH and URJC) or, under certain research lines, to carry out a 12-month advanced research project combined with a 12-month period devoted to applied research in one of the non-academic partner host institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fellows have to propose a comprehensive and innovative research project in the field of Smart Energy, in an area that aligns with UAH/URJC’s research areas. All fellows will have an academic mentor and will be integrated in one of the host research groups at UAH/URJC.
